            <h3>
                Introduction:

            </h3>
            <h2>Back in 2018, one animated movie by the name of "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" was
                released in theaters. The film was very well recieved between critics and viewers, for it's unique
                artstyle
                and experimental animation. The artstyle and animation was made to feel like you were watching a live
                action comic book, which the film captures perfectly.
                For example, they would make the framerate lower for certain characters in the film during moments where
                they want the characters movement appear
                swift by limiting the amount of frames you see for the character. With myself being a huge fan of this
                movie, I wanted to do a "year in review" of how this
                animation style has been the inspiration of animation movies in the last year. Below you can see the
                dates that the movies released on, and can select them to see an in-depth look at the animation and
                artstyle.
