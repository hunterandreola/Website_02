                <h1>The Animation</h1>
                <h5>Being the sequel to "Into the Spider-Verse," this film showcases even better animation. During this
                    action scene, you can see how all the characters are super quick and jumpy as they swing and
                    catapult through the air, making the scene super intense and interesting. The whole scene has the
                    characters at a slower framerate than the collaping building, showcasing the amount of speed these
                    characters show on screen.
                </h5>

                <h1>The Artstyle</h1>
                <h5>Just like the first film, this movie is a living comic book. There are moments where different
                    panels show up to zoom in an a characters face, just like it would look like in a comic book.
                    Another good example, are the words that come up for the sound effects. When the characters hit the
                    water tower, the word "BWOMM" fills the screen which majorly resembles comics, where they would
                    provide readers with the noise that the sound would have. </h5>
